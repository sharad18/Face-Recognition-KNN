# Face-Recognition-KNN
## Face Detection and Recognition using Open CV Library and KNN Algorithm

Data used for training the KNN Algorithm was first collected as follows and saved in .npy format.

Further after implementing the KNN Algorithm the faces in teh above images were recognised as follows:
